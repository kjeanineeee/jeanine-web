						<h2><b>Fablab Safety</b></h2>
						<p> During our first lesson on Fablab Safety, we were taught on basic rules to abide in the respective FABstudios. This lesson kinda gave me the secondary school vibe, when we were briefed about safety before stepping foot into our DNT Laboratories. Well, this just enhances the importance on safety...</p>
						
						<p> Next, we were taught on how to decipher the safety tags attached to each machines in the FABLabs. Steven even shared about different incidents regaring misuse of equipment, and not abiding safety precautions. Not going to lie, these incidents could have been prevented in the first place.   </p>
						
						<p> Since I'm a girl, I shall share about some rules that I got to abide when I am in the FABlab. </p>
						
						<p>1) Hair has to be tied up neatly <b>at all times</b>.This prevents getting our hair caught in the machine, which could lead to death via strangulation... </p>  
						
						<p>2) Students are required to <b>wear long pants/jeans</b> when they are using equipment in the Fablab. This prevents injuries caused by flying objects when we use equipment like a saw.</p>
						
						<p>3) Students are required to <b>wear covered shoes</b> in Fablab. This prevents injuries caused when we accidentally drop a sharp object.</p>
