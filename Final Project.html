						<h2><b>Final Project</b></h2>
						<p><b>On 31 January 2020</b>, we looked into the possible projects we couold work on. As stated in the final project requirement, the project work needs to include components made using 3D printing, laser cutting, and electronic parts.</P>
			                        <p> </p>
			<p><b><u> Project kickstarter </u></b></p>
			<p> As architecture students, we spend <b>all time, all day</b> immersed in our never-ending projects, catch up on our submissions, as well as toggle between multiple modules and presentations. Due to the workload imposed on us, meal and rest times are never on our minds. We frequently find ourselves packing food , rush-eating outside our studio, and as a result, scalding ourselves.</p>
	                <p> Hence, this sparked an idea for our project. </p>
			<p> </p>
			<p><b><u> Project SmartMat </u></b></p>
			<p> Project SmartMat is a smart table mat which comes with a <b>built-in temperature and humidity sensor</b> to help measure the temperature of our packed food. Not just that, the table mat also has a <b>LCD screen at the surface to show the measured temperature and humidity</b> of the packed food. This way, it can prevent the chances of getting scalded during meal times :)</p>
