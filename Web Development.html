						<h2><b>Web Development</b></h2>
						<p>For web development, the applications that we used were <b>Notepad++ and Github.io</b>.</p>
						<p>During the lessons, we were taught how to do coding on Notepad++, code our personal CSS files, and upload these files onto Github.io. Since I did not have any experience in coding, I struggled during the initial stages of web development. However, I did not have to worry that I could not keep up as there were video tutorials to guide us on how to code our own website from scratch.   </p>
						<p>From Steven's website, we used the following video tutorials to teach us on how to construct a default website from which we could work on to change and add points in the later part during our elective.</p>
